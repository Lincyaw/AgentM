"""Public surface of the AgentM extension catalog.

Implements §11 (Single-File, Self-Contained Extension Contract) of
``.claude/designs/extension-as-scenario.md``. The intent is to make
extensions a *mechanically checkable* unit so that future agents can edit
their own behavior without breaking the harness.

Hard rules (full text in design §11):

1. One built-in extension = one file under ``extensions/builtin/<name>.py``.
2. Module-level ``MANIFEST: ExtensionManifest`` declares what the extension
   is and what it accepts.
3. ``install(api, config)`` is the only callable surface.
4. Imports are restricted to a fixed allow-list (kernel, ops, harness
   contract modules, ``agentm.extensions``).

Authors should depend only on what this package re-exports — anything
under ``agentm.extensions.discover`` / ``agentm.extensions.validate`` is
tooling and not part of the extension-author surface.
