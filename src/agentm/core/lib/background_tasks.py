"""Generic registry for asyncio background units.

This is the substrate shared by every atom that runs work in a detached
``asyncio.Task`` while the agent keeps taking turns. It was extracted out of
``extensions/builtin/sub_agent.py`` (the original prototype, where the unit is
a child :class:`AgentSession`) so ``background_exec`` — whose unit is a single
tool coroutine — can sit on the same machinery without either atom importing
the other (forbids atom→atom imports; ``core.lib`` is the non-atom seam they
share).

Generalization boundary: this module owns only what is generic to *any*
asyncio background unit — the task handle, a free-text status string, an abort
signal, the registry dict + lock, slot accounting against ``max_workers``, and
cooperative cancellation. Everything specific to a unit (how it is spawned,
what its result means, how completion is rendered for the model, whether it
needs a delivery marker) stays in the owning atom, which subclasses
:class:`BackgroundTask` to carry its own fields and drives status transitions
itself. The registry never sets ``status`` or ``read`` — it only reads
``status`` for slot accounting — and never spawns work; the owner creates the
:class:`asyncio.Task` and calls :meth:`BackgroundTaskRegistry.register`.
